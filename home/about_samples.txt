--------
my primary area of interest is using machine learning, artificial intelligence and signal processing for computer security. 
I am particularly interested in understanding how deep learning can improve computer security. 
In the past, I have also done research in the areas of audio signal processing, adaptive filtering, statistical signal processing, biomedical signal processing and wireless communications.
--------------
I have a wide interest in Machine Learning spanning from optimization algorithms to distributed systems.
My current main research pursuit is reinforcement learning (RL) with focus on

off-policy, transferable, and data-efficient learning (e.g. via model-based methods)
and real-world optimal control applications, including indoor farming optimization and industrial robotics at large, etc.
Previously, Iâ€™ve also worked on

Convolutional neural nets and computer vision (object detection, image segmentation, image classification, etc.)
Image captioning and multimodal modeling
Optimization algorithms (SDCA, etc.)
DL/ML platform
-----------
My recent research focuses on applications of deep learning for data privacy. 
More specificaly I am investigating how generative adversarail netwroks can prevent information leakage while preserving data utility.
